# Glossary

This chapter is a reference point. You can return to it whenever a term appears in code, a formula, or an algorithm description and you want to quickly refresh its meaning without diving into theory.

### Accuracy (classification accuracy)

Accuracy is the fraction of correct predictions made by a model out of the total number of predictions. In simple terms, it answers the question: "In how many cases did the model guess correctly?"

Formally, accuracy is calculated as the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of examples.

Accuracy is convenient because it:

* is easy to compute
* is easy to interpret
* is intuitive

However, it has an important limitation: accuracy can be misleading on imbalanced datasets. For example, if 95% of the samples belong to one class, a model can achieve 95% accuracy simply by always predicting that class.

That is why accuracy is often used:

* as a baseline metric
* for an initial evaluation of a model
* together with other metrics (loss, precision, recall)

The intuitive meaning of accuracy is: "The percentage of cases where the model did not make a mistake." In machine learning, it is important to remember that high accuracy does not always mean a good model.

### Algorithm

An algorithm is a finite sequence of steps that transforms input data into a result. In machine learning, an algorithm usually defines how we adjust the model parameters – for example, gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, or k-nearest neighbors.

It is important to distinguish between a model and an algorithm: a model is the form of the relationship, while an algorithm is the method used to train or apply it.
