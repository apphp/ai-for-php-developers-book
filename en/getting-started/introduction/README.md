# Introduction

This book grew out of a simple observation: PHP developers almost always find themselves on the opposite side of the barricades from machine learning. On one side is the world of web applications, APIs, databases, business logic, and real users. On the other is a world of articles about neural networks, overloaded with formulas, Python code, and a persistent feeling that this is "not for us". As a result, AI is either perceived as a black box or ignored altogether.

The goal of this book is to remove this artificial division.

A PHP developer already knows how to think in terms of models, even if they have never called it machine learning. We constantly deal with functions, parameters, constraints, errors, and approximations. We write code that takes input data and produces an output, expecting it to be "good enough". Machine learning is a continuation of this logic – not magic, and not a separate discipline reserved for a chosen few.
