AI is a tool. Powerful and flexible – but not universal by nature, and certainly not all-powerful. PHP is a language used to build reliable and understandable systems. Together, they make it possible to solve problems that, not long ago, required large teams and complex infrastructure.

This book is not about hype or promises of "smart" code. It is about understanding, control, and deliberate use of technology.

If you are reading further, it means you care not just about using AI, but about truly understanding how it works and where it belongs in your projects.

In the next chapters, we will start from the very beginning and clarify what machine learning actually is, why it is not the same as neural networks, and why neural networks are only part of the bigger picture.
