# How to contribute

This book is written openly and iteratively. If you would like to help, there are many ways to do so. You do not need to write large sections or understand everything.

#### **How You Can Help**

You can:

* fix a mistake or typo
* suggest a clearer or more precise wording
* add a practical example
* propose a topic or idea for a chapter
* ask a question that is worth exploring

Even a small contribution is valuable.

#### **Practical Examples Are Especially Welcome**

If you have already tried using AI in PHP, it would be great to share your experience: how you approached it, what worked, what did not, and what challenges you faced.

This can be plain text or a small code snippet.

#### **How to Participate**

The simplest options:

* contact the author or leave feedback
* create an issue describing an idea or problem
* submit a fix via a pull request

It is okay if something is not perfect – everything can be discussed.

#### **A Few Important Notes**

* you do not need to write in a "smart" way
* you can ask questions
* you can disagree and have constructive debates
* there is no "single correct" approach here

This book is about practice and experience.

Everyone who contributes will be acknowledged.\
If you are unsure whether you should write – you probably should 🙂
